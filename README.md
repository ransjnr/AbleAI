  <h1>AbleAI: Accessible Policymaking Education for People with Disabilities <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-balance-scale">⚖️</i></span></h1>

  <p>AbleAI is an open-source AI project designed to empower people with disabilities by making policymaking education accessible and inclusive. Built upon the Gemini API, AbleAI strives to bridge the gap in policy knowledge and equip individuals with disabilities to actively participate in shaping policies that affect their lives.</p>

  <h2>Mission <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-dove">️</i></span></h2>

  <p>Our mission is to create a world where policymaking education is no longer a barrier for people with disabilities. We believe in fostering an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to understand, engage with, and influence policy decisions.</p>

  <h2>Vision <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-eye">️</i></span></h2>

  <p>We envision a future where AbleAI becomes a ubiquitous tool, seamlessly integrated into the policymaking landscape. We aim to see a diverse range of voices represented at the policy table, ensuring that policies are truly reflective of the needs and aspirations of all members of society.</p>
