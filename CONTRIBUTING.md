  <h1>AbleAI: Contributing Guidelines <span class="icon"><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i></span></h1>

  <p>We welcome contributions from the community! Your help is essential in making AbleAI a powerful tool for accessible policymaking education. These guidelines provide an overview of the contribution process and best practices to ensure a smooth and successful experience for everyone.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <p>Before you jump in, here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fork the Repository:** Create a copy of the AbleAI codebase on your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes and submit pull requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Set up your Development Environment:** Install Node.js and npm (or yarn) on your system. Refer to the instructions in the README file for details.</li>
    <li><strong>Clone your Fork:** Use the `git clone` command to download your forked repository to your local machine.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Making Changes</h2>

  <p>Once you're set up, you're ready to start making contributions! Here's the recommended workflow:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Identify an Issue:** Browse the existing issues on GitHub or suggest a new one if you have an improvement in mind.</li>
    <li><strong>Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch in your local repository for your specific changes. This helps isolate your work from the main codebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Changes:** Implement your code modifications and write clear, concise commit messages that describe your changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they don't introduce any regressions.</li>
    <li><strong>Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes to your local branch.</li>
    <li><strong>Push Your Changes:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Submitting a Pull Request</h2>

  <p>Once you've pushed your changes to your forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the main AbleAI repository. Here's what to do:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Open a Pull Request:** On GitHub, navigate to your forked repository and open a pull request. This will propose your changes to be merged into the main AbleAI codebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide a Clear Description:** In the pull request description, explain the purpose of your changes, how they address the issue (if applicable), and any additional details relevant to reviewers.</li>
    <li><strong>Respond to Feedback:** Project maintainers may provide feedback on your pull request. Be responsive and address any concerns raised to ensure a smooth merge.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Coding Style and Conventions</h2>

  <p>To maintain a consistent codebase, we encourage you to follow these guidelines:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Follow the conventions outlined in the project's existing codebase (e.g., indentation, variable naming).</li>
    <li>Write clean, well-commented code that is easy to understand and maintain.</li>
    <li>Use descriptive variable and function names.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Additional Resources</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>For further information and detailed coding conventions, refer to the project's style guide (if available).</li>
    <li>Join the AbleAI community forum (link to forum, if applicable) to connect with other contributors and discuss project development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Thank You!</h2>

  <p>We appreciate your interest in contributing to AbleAI! Your contributions are valuable in making policymaking education accessible to everyone. We look forward to collaborating with you to create a more inclusive and informed society.</p>
